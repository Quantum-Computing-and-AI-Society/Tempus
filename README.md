# Tempus
Repository of Tempus: a watch pricing forecast tool. Safiullah Shah &amp; Abdullah Shahid.

Introduction
As a massive watch nerd that one day wants to build his own collection of luxury watches, I’ve always been fascinated to see how the price of various models fluctuates over time, and what characteristics affect it. Therefore, I’ve chosen to develop “Tempus” (Latin for Time).
Tempus is a machine learning model that predicts the resale prices of luxury watches based on various factors such as brand, model, year of production, material, and other features. This project merges data science with the world of watchmaking. It will understand trends in watch pricing and help the common people understand market valuations. The more informed someone is regarding the market, the more confidently they can make a purchase, no matter what their intention for the watch, whether they purchase it as an investment, a family heirloom or anything else.

I’ve divided this individual project into 3 phases.
Phase I: Problem decomposition
Identify the key components of the project, what data and skills will be needed to execute the solution, and how this will be done. 
Duration: 2 weeks

Phase II: Skill development
Although I have aspirations to be a data scientist, I don’t yet have the required skills to execute a project like this. Therefore, this phase is dedicated to learning all the skills mentioned in Phase I, so that they can be utilized to develop the project.
Duration: 4 weeks

Phase III: Project execution
With the road map laid out and the skills acquired, begin work on the project.
Duration: 6 weeks

Finalized team
